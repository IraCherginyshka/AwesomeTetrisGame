"# AwesomeTetrisGame" 

Awesome Tetris Game 
=====================
Overview
-----------------------------------
The application will allow user to play Tetris by using controls such as Play, Pause and Reset and controls for rotating or moving blocks - Left, Right, Down, Drop, Rotation. User will be able to use mouse and keyboard, set customer settings (key assignment, show/hide labels for controls).
  
The application will show information about the level, score, speed, next block view. I will add functionality to the spinner component for visualization of loading status and a component for indication of losing the game. 

Also, the application will allow user to see leaderboard and become part of it by winning the game (for this functionality authorization and back-end will be used in the app).
